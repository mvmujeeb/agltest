Technology Used: jquery and Javascript

Since this is a simple application I  did not used any Javascript frameworks like AngularJS, Backbone, etc. As I discussed in the meeting I am very passionate about the pure Javascript here I am following conventional HTML, Javascript and for the REST integration I used jQuery.
